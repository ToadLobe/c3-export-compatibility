# Construct 3 Desktop Export Compatibility
A compatibility matrix for Construct 3 desktop export options.

This table documents the results of over 100 comptability tests carried out on multiple platforms. 
- Only features that differ between export options are listed in this table. 
- This table assumes that the new exporters (WebView2, WKWebView, and CEF on Linux) should be at least as cabale as the now retired NW.js exporter.
- The asterisk symbol indicates an important compatability caveat.
- Click on unsupported features to check for any existing GitHub issues.
- Features marked WIP are still being tested.
