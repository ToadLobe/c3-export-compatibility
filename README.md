This table documents the results of over 100 compatibility tests carried out on multiple platforms. 
- Only features that differ between export options are listed in this table. 
- This table assumes that the new exporters (WebView2, WKWebView, and CEF on Linux) should be at least as capable as the now retired NW.js exporter.
- The asterisk symbol indicates an important compatibility caveat.
- Click on unsupported features to check for any existing GitHub issues.
- Features marked WIP are still being tested.
